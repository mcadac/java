### Important information

1. The purpose of Java 8 Optional is clearly defined by Brian Goetz, Java’s language architect:
  ```
  Optional is intended to provide a limited mechanism for library method return types where there needed to be a clear way to represent “no result," and using null for such was overwhelmingly likely to cause errors.
  ```
